The following code retrieves the UCI Pittsburg Bridges Set and creates a data.frame consisting of columns for years erected, purpose, material, and type. 

```{r bridges-data-retrieval, fig.cap="Retreives and codes Pittsburgh Bridges Data Set", eval = TRUE}

#retrieve and load data into a data.frame 
theUrl <- "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/bridges/bridges.data.version1"
dat <- read.table(file = theUrl, header = FALSE, sep = ",", na.string = c("?"))

#Pick and name Columns
bridges <- subset(dat, select = c(4, 5, 10, 13))
colnames(bridges) <- c("erected", "purpose", "material", "b_type")
summary(bridges)

#check the data.frame
class(bridges)
summary(bridges)
```
