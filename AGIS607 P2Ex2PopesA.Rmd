Importing and cleaning data
```{r}
require(dplyr)
require(tidyr)
require(stringr)

popedat <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\Andrew\\Desktop\\Cuny\\Data Acquisition\\Project 2\\Ex2Popes\\popefavs.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#renaming
colnames(popedat)[1] <- "date"
colnames(popedat)[4] <- "noopinion"

#create a column of pope names
popedat$name[14:18] <- "John Paul II"
popedat$name[7:11] <- "Benedict XVI"
popedat$name[3:4] <- "Francis"

#removing empty rows
popepoll <- popedat[popedat$Unfavorable != "" & popedat$Unfavorable != "%",]

#coercing vectors to preferred types
popepoll$date <- as.character(popepoll$date)
popepoll$Favorable <- as.numeric(popepoll$Favorable)
popepoll$Unfavorable <- as.numeric(popepoll$Unfavorable)
popepoll$noopinion <- as.numeric(popepoll$noopinion)

#extracting beginning and end data from survey fielding dates
year <- as.numeric(str_sub(popepoll$date, start = -4))
startmonth <- as.character(word(popepoll$date,1))
startmonthnum <- match(str_sub(startmonth, end = 3), month.abb)
endmonth <- as.character(str_extract(word(popepoll$date, start = 2), "[:alpha:]+"))
endmonth[is.na(endmonth)] <- startmonth[is.na(endmonth)] #was fun to figure out
endmonthnum <- match(str_sub(endmonth, end = 3), month.abb)
startday <- as.numeric(str_sub(str_extract(popepoll$date, "[:digit:]+-"), end = -2))
endday <- as.numeric(str_sub(str_extract(popepoll$date, "[:digit:]+,"), end = -2))

#concatenating and formatting date data 
popepoll$startdate <- as.Date(paste(startmonthnum, startday, year, sep = "/"), format = "%m/%d/%Y")
popepoll$enddate <- as.Date(paste(endmonthnum, endday, year, sep = "/"), format = "%m/%d/%Y")
```

Tidying data, although not entirely sure when the tidying process has technically started
```{r}
popepolltidy <- popepoll[,c("name", "startdate", "enddate", "Favorable", "Unfavorable", "noopinion")] %>%
  gather(favorability, favscores, Favorable:noopinion)

str(popepolltidy)
```

On average through their tenure, Francis and John Paul II had similarly high favorables, while Benedict XVI was slightly less known
```{r}
#look at averaged favorables
popepolltidy %>%
  group_by(name, favorability) %>%
  summarize(averagescores = mean(favscores)) %>%
  spread(favorability, averagescores) %>%
  mutate(netfav = `Favorable` - `Unfavorable`)
```

While Francis has held the papacy for only a fraction of the time of his last 2 predecessors, he's grown in popularity quite quickly, similar to the movement John Paul saw over his entire tenure. 

Benedict, however, became increasingly unpopular during his reign. Despite being a well educated and liberal theologian, he advocated a return to fundamental Christian values to counter the increasing secularism of western countries, and eventually was moved to resign, giving way to the more open and accepting direction of Francis. 
```{r}
#create table of last opinion polls of tenure
lastpolls <- popepolltidy %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  top_n(3, startdate) %>%
  spread(favorability, favscores) %>%
  mutate(netfavorable = Favorable - Unfavorable) %>%
  mutate(awareness = Favorable + Unfavorable)

#create table of first opinion polls of tenure
firstpolls <- popepolltidy %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  arrange(desc(startdate), name, favorability) %>%
  do(tail(., n=3)) %>% #this took some research. Dplyr has top_n, but not bottom_n. When you order dates descending, top_n reorders dates into ascending, so I had to go out of book. 
  arrange(name) %>%
  spread(favorability, favscores) %>%
  mutate(netfavorable = Favorable - Unfavorable) %>%
  mutate(awareness = Favorable + Unfavorable)

#calculate opinion movement over time
popepollsdiff <- data.frame(lastpolls$name)
popepollsdiff$timeframedays <- lastpolls$enddate - firstpolls$enddate
popepollsdiff$favchange <- lastpolls$Favorable - firstpolls$Favorable
popepollsdiff$unfavchange <- lastpolls$Unfavorable - firstpolls$Unfavorable
popepollsdiff$noopinchange <- lastpolls$noopinion - firstpolls$noopinion
popepollsdiff$netfavchange <- lastpolls$netfavorable - firstpolls$netfavorable
popepollsdiff$awarenesschange <- lastpolls$awareness - firstpolls$awareness
popepollsdiff
```
